# Rin
Rin is a Discord Bot whose main purpose is to help with moderation & server settings, as well as provide a way for members to play songs in voice channels and more. It's a project started by me (`⭐kyllian1212 / Lysk⭐#1212`) in October 2020, with an initial "alpha" version with Discord.py v1.5.1 (iirc), and has been rewritten entirely in September 2022 with Discord.py v2.0.0 to support slash commands and the new Discord API (among other things).

# Verified servers
This bot's code is open source so anyone can add it to their own server if they wish to. Those servers are however the only ones where the bot is hosted by me officially. If you see the bot in any other server I'm not responsible of what happens there!

* [Madeon Discord](https://discord.gg/madeon)
* [Porter Robinson Discord](https://discord.gg/porterrobinson)

I will eventually open up the bot to be added officially to anyone's server via an OAuth2 link but for now it'll stay in those servers.

# Use 
* Rename .env.example to .env
* Fill all the variables in .env
* Run main.py
